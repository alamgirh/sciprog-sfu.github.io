                    We are scientific programming study group whose home-base is at Simon 
                    Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby, BC, Canada. Our group meets on a 
                    weekly basis for peer-facilitated study-sessions on topics under the 
                    broad umbrella of using computers to do scientific research more 
                    effectively and efficiently. This includes using Python for DNA
					sequence analysis, plotting and statistical analysis of environmental 
					data in R, automating repetitive tasks with the shell, general best 
					practices in coding, using tools such as Git and Github to 
					collaborate effectively with others, and much much more. </h3>
					
					<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">All are welcome to this 
					study group, regardless of scientific research area, affiliation or 
					training level. </h3>
