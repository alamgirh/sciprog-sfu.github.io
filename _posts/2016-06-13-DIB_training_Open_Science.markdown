title: DIB training Open Science half day workshop
text: How much code do you think is written in your lab that never makes it under version control? The ideal answer is none, but realistically, it might be most if not all. This workshop will introduce you to strategies and workflows to make not only your code, but many aspects of your research more transparent, reproducible and open. Registration required.
