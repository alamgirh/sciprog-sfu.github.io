## Description

(Description of why people should come to your workshop and what you will
be teaching. For more information on what and how you can teach, see 
[our guide](README.md) on leading a workshop.)

(Also, make sure the issue title is a short and catchy description of your 
workshop, and include your name. For instance: "Crafting publication-worthy figures using ggplot2 and cowplot by Leslie Pineda".)

(You can also upload a promotional image for your workshop so we can 
share it on [our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sciprog/). 
Feel free to use [our image templates](../image-templates).)

## Time and Place

**Where:** Room 7010, Library Research Commons, SFU Burnaby Campus

## Registration

(A link will be added here by an admin once a library registration page is
created. Don't worry about this for now.)

## Required Preparation

### Assumed Knowledge

prerequisite knowledge. For example, if you’re going to teach about an R 
package, it’s recommended that you assume familiarity with the R language.)

to delete the following sections and post the link.)

help to post the files online.)

set up and lead the lesson by helping learners with questions.)
