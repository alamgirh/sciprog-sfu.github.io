# How to Lead a Study Group Session

We believe in a dynamic workshop format, inspired by the successful Software Carpentry workshops. This way, you're engaging your audience instead of throwing information at them. Here are a few pointers on how to lead a session. 

## Design the lesson for a one-hour time slot

A hands-on lesson is hard to time, because a lot of it depends on your pace and this will be determined on the day of your presentation depending on your audience. Your best bet is to plan to cover the basics in an hour given a slow pace, but have some optional material if things go well. 

## Ensure the topic is of general interest

This study group is for scientific programming. Hence, the audience members will have diverse backgrounds. Your lesson should take this into account and not be too specific in application. Of course, you can use your own data for demonstration purposes, but try to keep it of general interest. 

## No lecture slides, just live demos

First of all, lecture slides about programming are boring. It's much more engaging if you demonstrate the code you're presenting. It shows that it's easy and possible, because you're doing it right in front of the audience. Second of all, it allows your audience to follow you as you go along. 

## Include some challenge questions

One easy way to test if your audience is understanding what you're demonstrating is to provide them with a challenge question. This is specific task that is feasible given the material you've already taught them. It allows you to help out those who are having trouble. And who doesn't enjoy the rush of dopamine when you get something to work?
