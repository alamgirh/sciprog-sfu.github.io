# How to Lead a Study Group Session

We want your workshops to be the best they can be. We believe in a dynamic teaching style that engages the audience. To achieve this here are a few guidelines for leading a study group session. 

## Design the lesson for a one-hour time slot

It's hard to time a hands-on lesson, because it depends on your audience and their preferred pace. Your best bet is to plan to cover the basics within an hour given a slow pace, but have some optional material at the end if things go well. 

## Ensure the topic is of general interest

This study group is for scientific programmers. Hence, the audience members will come from diverse backgrounds. Your lesson should take this into account and not be too domain-specific. Of course, you can use your own data for demonstration purposes, but try to keep it of general interest. 

## No lecture slides, just live demos

It's much more engaging if you demonstrate the code you're presenting as opposed to just lecturing. It ensures that your audience can follow you as you go along. 

## Include some challenge questions

One easy way to test if your audience is understanding what you're demonstrating is to provide them with challenge questions. It allows you to make sure everyone is on the same page and help out those who are having trouble. And who doesn't enjoy the rush of dopamine when you get something to work?

## Use the Sticky Note Methodâ„¢

We're not gonna lie about this: this idea is straight-up taken from Software Carpentry's book, because it works! The organizers will be providing each audience member with two differently coloured sticky notes. One will signify "I'm good!", while the other will signal "Help!" During challenge questions, this will allow those who raised the "I'm good" flag to help each other out. Collaboration is key!

## Share the love! (And the notes)

As we've said, we're all about collaboration. This includes sharing your lesson notes. Not only does this permit study group members to refer back to the lesson, but it also allows others (here or elsewhere) to give the lesson themselves.
